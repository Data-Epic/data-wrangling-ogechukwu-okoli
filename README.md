# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes various factors that influence student performance across different subjects using dataset student-scores.csv. It explores relationships between study habits, extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, attendance, and academic success using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Research Questions
1. **Impact of Self-Study Hours**: How do weekly self-study hours affect student scores across different subjects?
2. **Effect of Part-Time Jobs**: Do students with part-time jobs perform differently compared to those without jobs?
3. **Absenteeism and Performance**: Is there a relationship between absence days and lower academic performance?
4. **Extracurricular Activities**: Do extracurricular activities help or hurt student performance?
5. **Subject Correlation**: Which subject has the strongest correlation with overall academic success?

## Dataset

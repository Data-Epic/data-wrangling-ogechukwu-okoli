Student Performance Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes various factors that influence student performance across different subjects using the dataset student-scores.csv. It explores relationships between study habits, extracurricular activities, part-time jobs, attendance, and academic success using data analysis and visualization techniques.

Research Questions

Impact of Self-Study Hours: How do weekly self-study hours affect student scores across different subjects?

Effect of Part-Time Jobs: Do students with part-time jobs perform differently compared to those without jobs?

Absenteeism and Performance: Is there a relationship between absence days and lower academic performance?

Extracurricular Activities: Do extracurricular activities help or hurt student performance?

Subject Correlation: Which subject has the strongest correlation with overall academic success?

Dataset

The dataset contains information on student demographics, academic performance, study habits, attendance, and participation in extracurricular activities. Data preprocessing and cleaning steps ensure accurate and meaningful insights.

Methodology
